## Experiments-As-a-Service-Infrastructure (EASI)

Instructional decisions about digital educational resources can impact thousands, from practice problems
in K12 to tutorial webpages in university and community college. The current versions of resources are
arguably too infrequently tested against alternatives, in order to use data about learning to choose the
best. 

We aim to make it easier to get evidence from randomized field experiments that compare
alternative instructional approaches, to identify which versions quantifiably impact learning outcomes. For
example, experiments have identified methods for making students so motivated that they score half a
letter grade higher, by identifying how and when to prompt students to reflect on a course's personal
relevance (Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009)[^1]. 

We propose the Experiments-As-a-Service-Infrastructure
(EASI) to enable a collaborative ecosystem of experimentation in real-world educational settings. EASI
aims to lower the barriers for designing, deploying, analyzing and adapting educational field experiments .
